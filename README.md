# Corona-Severity

The project is useful in determining the severity of corona in a patient , that is , what is the seriousness of disease in the patients body and will characterise it as , low risk , moderate , high risk and will also be telling whether the patient needs hospitalization or not.
The determination of severity is on the basis of certain characteristics , which are broadly divided into 3 categories.
.BMI of the patient 
.Patient Details 
.Inflammatory details.
All of these 3 categories are medically assigned certain points if they full fill the conditions as mentioned . 
In the final state , the sum of these points will lead to determine the severity of corona 

if total point<6 ----->low risk
If total points >6 and <=14--moderate risk , hospitalization can be required
If total points >14 -high risk , hospitalization must.
